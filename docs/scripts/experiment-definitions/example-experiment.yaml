# an experiment file consists of several sections that describe different aspects of the experiment

# each key should be the name of the key to override in the template, or a path to that key if nested (e.g. "a/b/c")
# each value must be a list, to allow for parameter sweeps; if the value is itself a list, it must be nested in another
#       list, e.g. [[1, 2, 3]] instead of [1, 2, 3]

# values that should sweep a range should be defined as a dictionary with min, max, and step keys
# e.g. { "min": 0.01, "max": 0.25, "step": 0.005 }
# this will be generated into the needed list of values before expansion
# you may also include an optional "suffix" key to append to the end of each value, e.g. " ms" or " MiB"

# this defines the starting template for the experiment; anything not otherwise specified will be taken from here
"_template": [ "experiment-templates/template-1.yaml" ]

"_num_relays": [ 0 ]
"_topology_type": [ "custom" ]  # one of ring, star, small world, erdos renyi, clique, or custom
  # if topology_type is custom, you can specify (in _topology_edges) the topology as a list of directed edge 5-tuples
# each tuple is [from, to, latency, download, upload], and you may specify -1 for any value to indicate "no limit"
# node label indices start at 0, and the first _num_producers nodes are producers, and the next _num_relays are relays
