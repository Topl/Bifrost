# Setting up a new virtual environment

First, we must create a new virtual environment. This is a Python environment that is separate from your system Python environment. This is important because we want to install the dependencies for this project without affecting your system Python environment. To create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```python -m venv venv```

To load the required dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
