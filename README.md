Project Bifrost is a Scala client designed over a cryptocurrency/blockchain protocol developed to achieve three specific goals:
- Facilitate movement and investment of capital from investors in developed economies to businesses in developing economies
- Create a commodity market that collateralizes a stable currency via storage and redemption
- Develop a reputation system and historical reference of business behaviour
