Getting Started
---------------
If you have played around with the client and found some issues that crashes the client, be sure to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Topl/Bifrost/issues)
* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.


Improving and updating the [Wiki](https://github.com/Topl/Bifrost/wiki) is always welcomed. It is probably the easiest way to be involved with open-source development. Everyone will love you forever for doing this.

* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* `git clone https://github.com/Topl/Bifrost.wiki.git`
* Create a new repository on your github account. Let's call it "Bifrost-Wiki".
* Remove the original "origin" remote and add your github repo as new "origin" `git remote rm origin` and `git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/Bifrost-Wiki.git`
* Make your proposed changes locally, then push them to your github account: `git push -u origin main` (`-u origin main` only required the first time; afterwards just do `git push`)
* Submit a ticket to our Github issue tracker requesting maintainers to review your changes and merge them in. Please be sure to include a link to your repo and describe what you've changed.

Making Changes
--------------

1. Fork the repository to your Github account.
  * Make any new branches from the `dev` branch, unless specifically targeting another feature branch or applying a hotfix to the `main` branch

2. Make commits
3. Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
4. Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
5. Run `sbt clean preparePR` to check linting, formatting, and that all tests pass
6. Submit a [new pull request](https://github.com/Topl/Bifrost/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) in the proper format:

```
