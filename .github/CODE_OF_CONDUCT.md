# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community on Github a strictly technical activity. This means that we will enforce our No Tolerance Policy without hesitation.

## No Tolerance Policy
* Any discussions, either explicit or implicit, regarding age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, is forbidden. The user that initiated such dicussion will be given one and only one warning. Subsequent violations will result in the user being blocked.
* Any user participating in unacceptable behaviors as described in Our Standards section will result in the user being immediately blocked.
* Any participation in price speculation of cryptocurrencies is forbidden. The user that initiated such dicussion will be given one and only one warning. Subsequent violations will result in the user being blocked.
* Any off-topic discussions, including but not limited to politics, the economy, what you ate for lunch today, etc, are forbidden. The user that initiated such dicussion will be given one and only one warning. Subsequent violations will result in the user being blocked. If you are not sure if something is off-topic, ask. Make sure you explicitly state the technical link your commentary has to this project. If there is no direct relation between your comment and this project, do not write it.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior by participants:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably result in dismissal in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct will only be enforced regarding activities within this repository. This means actions taken by contributors on other platforms such as Twitter, Slack, Facebook, etc. are not relevant to enforcement of this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at info@topl.me. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Spurious reports or spam-like reports may result in the reporter being blocked.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
